			<h1>Model Types</h1>
		</header>

		<main>
			<p>
				In Hordes, similar to Warmachine, there are various types of
				models that make up the forces of each faction. Each model type
				serves a specific role on the battlefield, and players must
				strategically use them to achieve victory. As of my last update
				in September 2021, here are the main model types in Hordes:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Warlock:</strong> The central figure in each
						Hordes army, the warlock is a powerful leader gifted
						with the ability to control and channel the primal power
						known as fury. They lead their forces into battle and
						support their warbeasts with unique spells and
						abilities.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Warbeasts:</strong> The core of a Hordes army,
						warbeasts are primal creatures led by warlocks. They
						channel and generate fury, a volatile resource that
						allows them to unleash powerful attacks and abilities.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Units:</strong> Units in Hordes consist of
						groups of infantry, beasts, or warriors that fight
						together as a cohesive force. They can be specialized in
						different roles, such as melee combat, ranged attacks,
						or support abilities.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Solos:</strong> Solos are individual models with
						unique abilities and often serve as specialists or
						champions. They can be warlocks' assistants, skilled
						warriors, or versatile utility models.

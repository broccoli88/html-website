							<h3>Warmachine</h3>
						</a>
						<p>
							Warmachine is a fast-paced skirmish-level wargame
							that focuses on intense battles between powerful
							warcasters and their mechanized warjacks. In this
							game, players take on the role of a warcaster, a
							powerful and magically gifted leader who commands an
							army of warjacks, which are large steam-powered,
							mechanical constructs equipped with devastating
							weaponry. The game emphasizes strategy, positioning,
							and resource management.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each warcaster has unique spells and abilities that
							can dramatically influence the battlefield. Warjacks
							can be customized with various weapons and equipment
							to suit different tactical situations. Warmachine is
							renowned for its balanced gameplay and competitive
							tournament scene

							<h3>Hordes</h3>
						</a>
						<p>
							Hordes is a sister game to Warmachine, also set in
							the Iron Kingdoms. In this game, players assume the
							role of powerful warlocks who lead savage and
							monstrous creatures known as warbeasts into battle.
							Unlike the mechanized warjacks of Warmachine,
							warbeasts are primal and ferocious, tapping into the
							natural energies of the world to unleash devastating
							attacks.
						</p>
						<p>
							Warlocks have their own set of unique spells and
							abilities and can channel fury, a volatile resource
							generated by their warbeasts' aggressive actions.
							The game revolves around resource management, as
							warbeasts can become uncontrollable if not carefully
							managed.

				<p>
					The key distinction between Warmachine and Hordes lies in
					the types of armies they feature: Warmachine focuses on
					armies led by warcasters and composed mainly of warjacks,
					while Hordes centers on armies led by warlocks and
					predominantly consisting of warbeasts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both games offer a rich and immersive gaming experience,
					combining deep lore, stunning miniatures, and engaging
					tactical gameplay. Players can collect and paint their
					armies, then engage in thrilling battles against opponents
					in a world of high magic, steam-powered technology, and
					brutal combat.

			<h1>Model Types</h1>
		</header>

		<main>
			<p>
				In Warmachine, there are several types of models that make up
				the armies of each faction. Each model type serves a specific
				role on the battlefield, and players must strategically use them
				to achieve their objectives. As of my last update in September
				2021, here are the main model types in Warmachine:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Warcaster:</strong> The central figure in each
						army, the warcaster is a powerful leader gifted with
						arcane abilities. They control the warjacks and cast
						spells to support their forces.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Warjacks:</strong> Massive steam-powered
						mechanical constructs, warjacks are the centerpiece of
						each army. There are different classes of warjacks, such
						as light, heavy, and colossal, each with unique
						strengths and roles.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Units:</strong> Units consist of groups of
						infantry or warriors that fight together as a cohesive
						force. They can be specialized in different roles, such
						as melee combat, ranged attacks, or support abilities.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Solos:</strong> solos are individual models with
						unique abilities and often serve as specialists or
						champions. They can be warcasters' assistants, skilled
						warriors, or versatile utility models.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Battle Engines:</strong> Large and powerful
						constructs, battle engines are war machines with unique
						abilities that can drastically impact the battlefield.
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>Colossals:</strong> These are massive warjacks
						that tower over regular ones. Colossals are extremely
						powerful and serve as formidable assets in an army
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Structures:</strong> These models represent
						fortifications, buildings, or other constructs on the
						battlefield. They can provide cover and other advantages
						to their faction.

					In Warmachine, the types of play are categorized based on
					the number of points allocated to each player's army. The
					point size determines the size and scale of the battle.
					There are 4 primary point-levels:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Small (0 - 25 pts)</li>
					<li>Standard (25 - 50 pts)</li>
					<li>Large (50 - 75 pts)</li>
					<li>High Command (75+ pts)</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Short match overview:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Army Building:</strong> Before the match, each
						player constructs their army using a specified point
						limit (e.g., 25, 50, or 75 points). They select their
						warcaster or warlock, warjacks or warbeasts, units,
						solos, and attachments to form their battle group.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>Deployment:</strong> Players take turns
						deploying their models in their respective deployment
						zones. The location and positioning of units are crucial
						as they set the stage for the upcoming battle.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>Turn Sequence:</strong> The game is played over
						a series of rounds, with each round consisting of two
						player turns. Players alternate activating their models
						during their turns.
					</li>
					<br />

					<li>
						<strong>Activation:</strong> During a player's turn,
						they activate their models one at a time, performing
						actions such as moving, attacking, casting spells, or
						using special abilities. Each model has a specific
						activation cost, meaning players must carefully plan
						their actions to optimize their strategies.
					</li>
					<br />

					<li>
						<strong>Combat and Resolution:</strong> When models
						engage in combat, they use their respective weapons and
						abilities to attack opponents. Attacks are resolved
						using dice rolls and comparing various statistics.
						Damage dealt to models may result in the loss of hit
						points or specific effects, depending on the type of
						attack.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>Scenario Objectives:</strong> Many matches
						include scenario objectives or victory conditions beyond
						merely eliminating the opponent's forces. Players may
						need to control specific points on the battlefield,
						protect key targets, or complete specific objectives to
						win.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>Focus and Fury Management:</strong>
						Warcasters manage focus, while warlocks manage fury
						during their turns. These resources fuel their
						abilities, spells, and control over warjacks and
						warbeasts. Effective resource management is vital for
						success.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>Tactics and Strategy:</strong> Players must
						adapt to the unfolding battle, adjusting their tactics
						based on their opponent's moves and the changing
						battlefield conditions. Tactical positioning, threat
						assessment, and resource allocation play crucial roles
						in determining the oustcome of the match.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The match concludes when
						one player achieves the victory conditions, which could
						be scenario-based or through the complete elimination of
						the opponent's warcaster or warlock.
					</li>
					<br />
